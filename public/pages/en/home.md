Graduate and **computer enthusiast**, I decided to create this website to develop my skills but also to expose and highlight all that I have learned during my training in **Arts et MÃ©tiers** school but also in my professional and personal experiences.

So you will find here my resume with my different [trainings and experiences] (/experiences).

I hope that all the information on this website will help you better understand who I am.

This is my first website, do not hesitate to let me return in the [Contact](contact) page.

Thank you and enjoy your visit!
